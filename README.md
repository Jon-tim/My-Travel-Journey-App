# My-Travel-Journey-App
A static App that documents places that have been visited with details of each location.

This app was created utilizing project-based learning approach to facilitate deep grasping of the fundamentals of React.
I basically practiced props with this project by passing data dynamically through components from a source (an array of objects).
